## Introduction
This project makes use of data from the US Census Bureau and it American Community Survey program to show some characteristics of the US population at a county level.<br>
Histograms representing demographic information, such as population, population density and size are presented by county and in a coropleth map representation. Also we will study US county characteristics and how they correlate with their population number and density. New datasets, plots and charts will be incorporated here as we have them available.

## Initial overview
Describing geographic, demographic and economic information based on counties as unit of information present some attractive characteristics. One of them is its diversity, with areas, population and population densities that span over many order of magnitude, as it can be seen in the histograms of figure 1.
